- vcd-format.md
  - Reference notes and guidance about the VCD file format as relevant to parsing.

- samples/
  - Example inputs and reference outputs for quick verification.
  - OVERVIEW.md: Describes the sample collection and intent.
  - ref_build.jx: Reference test/build configuration for running validations.
  - t0001.vcd â€¦ t0030.vcd: Input VCD files covering a range of features and edge cases.
  - tXXXX.recMl files: Expected impulse record outputs to compare against imports.
  - Variants like t0002_range.recMl, t0002_select.recMl: Expected outputs for specific property configurations (e.g., time range, include/exclude).
